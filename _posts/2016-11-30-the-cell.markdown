[BROOK ANDREW](http://www.brookandrew.com) is one of Australia’s premiere contemporary artists, having exhibited internationally since 1996. His work examines Western history, specifically relating to colonialism, and places Australia at the centre of a global inquisition. ANDREW’s work spans across video, sculpture, photography and immersive installations. 

The SUBSTATION presents the Melbourne premiere of ANDREW’s major installation THE CELL. Decorated in Wiradjuri patterns and inviting audience participation, THE CELL is a jumping castle of sorts, that blurs the lines between sanctuary and detention.
