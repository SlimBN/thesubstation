THE VIETNAM ARCHIVE PROJECT by [PHUONG NGO](http://www.pthngo.com) is an ongoing artwork started in 2010. Currently consisting over 10,000 items, including slides, photos, documents and objects; this ever-growing collection explores histories that have come to define the personal and collective identities of Vietnamese communities, both within and outside of Vietnam.

CONFLICTED explores the political and social aspects of war through the lens of service men and women. Utilising found images and objects from the VIETNAM ARCHIVE PROJECT, the exhibition comprises a series of intimate moments and large scale installations offering a nuanced and alternative reading of the Vietnam War.

Presented by The SUBSTATION and the Human Rights Arts and Film Festival
