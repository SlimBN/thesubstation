Part music performance, part installation, ONO is a place to gather, listen and share. Drawing on traditions of oral storytelling, four musical offerings will each spin a yarn of ambient and abstract sounds in the belly of The SUBSTATION. ONO seeks to break down the usual back and forth between artist and listener, to create an inclusive and reverberating space of exchange. Bring your imagination on an excursion into outer sound.
