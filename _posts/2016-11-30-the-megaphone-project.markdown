##[MADELEINE FLYNN & TIM HUMPHREY](http://madeleineandtim.net/)**

THE MEGAPHONE PROJECT is an interactive sound installation that has engaged over 100,000 people around the world. Taking place in The SUBSTATION’s grand main space, the work explores sound and physical play. The striking red megaphones collect people’s voices that then return unexpectedly via a wireless network. The result is a mixture of order and chaos, anarchy and contemplation as the audience creates a lively environment of play that is their own invention. 

Collaborating artists: David Wells, Jennifer Hector
