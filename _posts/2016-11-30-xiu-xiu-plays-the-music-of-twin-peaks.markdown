The iconic music of American TV series [Twin Peaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks) by composer Angelo Badalamenti and David Lynch is given a makeover in this special live performance by acclaimed experimental pop group [XIU XIU](http://www.xiuxiu.org/).

Led by JAMIE STEWART, ANGELA SEO and SHAYNA DUNKELMAN, the music of XIU XIU defies simple description. It is a complex mix of post punk and synth pop, classical and experimental styles, full of brutality and emotional depth.

XIU XIU’s performance isn’t simply a recreation of the Twin Peaks music, but provides an entirely new interpretation that emphasises its chaos, drama, fear, noise and sidelong leering glances. 

Presented by The SUBSTATION in association with Room40
