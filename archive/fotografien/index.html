<h2 id="about-the-artist">About the artist</h2>

<p><strong>SVEN MARQUARDT</strong> started his career in photography during the early eighties in East Berlin. After his education as camera assistant and photographer at DEFA (GDR’s public-owned film studio), MARQUARDT’s first publications appeared in Der Sonntag and Das Magazin. From 1985 until 1986, MARQUARDT worked as an assistant for Rudolf Schäfer – an iconic figure in East Germany’s photo scene. Next to his work as  fashion photographer MARQUARDT took exceptional black and white photographs of East Berlin’s Prenzlauer Berg scene. After the Wall came down, he immersed himself into the burgeoning club scene of a unified Berlin and processed his impressions in his exhibitions.</p>
