<h2 id="about-the-artist">About the artist</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.natalieabbott.net/"><strong>NATALIE ABBOTT</strong></a> creates sensorial performance experiences. Her work deals with endurance based practices, exhausting bodies to create new dialogues between the audience and performer. She is currently interested in failure and how this can be explored within the performance context. Her research currently involves exploring how to perform ‘authentic’ failure, how to attempt and tempt failure to occur. Within this research, Natalie is interested in pulling apart attachment to the preconceived, of allowing and celebrating something that is imperfect and exploring the choreographic potential within that.</p>
