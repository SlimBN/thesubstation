            <p>CAIN AND ABEL is an electrifying theatrical experience, a provocative and bloody retelling of a story that has stained the earth and our psyche for millennia.</p>

<p>The biblical story of <a href="http://therabble.com.au/cain-abel/">CAIN AND ABEL</a> is the tale of the first act of violence – an act that ricocheted across time. It envisions our history as man on man, brother on brother, blood on the earth. Well beyond its religious beginnings, it is a story that has defined our contemporary understanding of violence. <a href="http://therabble.com.au/">THE RABBLE</a> has reimagined the story as a female one, with two sisters at the centre of the work (MARY HELEN SASSMAN and DANA MILTINS). The sisters recreate the first act of violence over and over again – from biblical sanctity to the spectacle of Hollywood. This is THE RABBLE at their best: a brave, iconoclastic and visually arresting work that questions our core assumptions about femininity and violence.</p>
