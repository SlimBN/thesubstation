            <p>Delve into the fanciful and illusionary worlds of two extraordinary choreographers, STEPHANIE LAKE and ROSS MCCORMACK as they fall down the rabbit hole of imagination and fill in the blanks.</p>

<p>IF______WAS______ is both an investigation into choreographic practice and a sensory representation of each artist’s personal library of lived experience generated in response to a strict framework of equal limitations.</p>

<p>Artistic Director, KYLE PAGE set the challenge for each artist to select sound from the one sound score, create costumes from one pattern, utilise lighting from one design and work to a set duration. It is within these parameters that IF______WAS______ comes to life.</p>

<p>Audiences are invited to experience this double bill that celebrates our differences and questions what is unique to us.</p>

<p>IF______WAS______is a bold new work, raw, pared back, alive.</p>

<p>“A gripping visceral sixty minute experience and one not to be missed by lovers of contemporary dance.” Arts Hub, of STEPHANIE LAKE.</p>
