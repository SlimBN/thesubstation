            <p><a href="http://www.pthngo.com/vietnam-archive-project">THE VIETNAM ARCHIVE PROJECT</a> is an ongoing artwork initially starting as a material research project in 2010 in Melbourne. Currently consisting in excess of 5000 items, including slides, photos, film reels and objects. This ever-growing collection has emerged as an act in acquiring and curating found histories and memories that have come to define <a href="http://www.pthngo.com/">PHUONG NGO</a>’s personal identity of and that of the wider Vietnamese Diaspora that has emerged since the fall of Saigon in 1975.</p>

<p>The materiality of <a href="http://www.pthngo.com/vietnam-archive-project">THE VIETNAM ARCHIVE PROJECT</a> has been utilised to further extend NGO’s practice developing artworks, investigating ways in which history is understood, altered and how personal experiences and inherited memory and experience dictate this.</p>

<p>In the lead up to his 2017 exhibition at THE SUBSTATION, NGO will discuss the archive in depth with JUDE ANDERSON (<a href="http://www.punctum.com.au/punctum">PUNCTUM</a>), covering various topics including the role of the archive in informing identity; the use of found and vernacular photography in art; and works that have derived from the archive. In conjunction with this key images and items from <a href="http://www.pthngo.com/vietnam-archive-project">THE VIETNAM ARCHIVE PROJECT</a> will be presented that inform works currently in development.</p>

<p>The forum will take place as part of <a href="http://2015.hraff.org.au/">HUMAN RIGHTS ARTS AND FILM FESTIVAL</a>.</p>
