            <p><a href="http://cargocollective.com/emmacollard/">EMMA COLLARD</a> is a 23 year old artist from Melbourne. COLLARD employs brightly coloured artificial materials (vinyl fabric, piping, and netting) as well as bodily shaped mirrors and cameras to create elaborate sets for performances. The work explores material misbehaviour, as these sets are installed by their own material needs, as the bodily shaped mirror’s viewpoint often becomes the dictator for where the entire apparatus can function spatially for a performance. COLLARD also explores how colour can facilitate a situation where a specific humour, action, shape or moment can be set up and articulated by a colour like bright pink or yellow.</p>

<p>COLLARD holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts with First Class Honours from the Victorian College of the Arts, University of Melbourne (2015). Recent exhibitions include ‘Back soon x,’ a collaborative exhibition at Bus Projects, Melbourne (with <a href="https://vimeo.com/113991715">KENDAL MCQUIRE</a> and <a href="http://cheriepeele.com/cheriepeele/HOME.html">CHERIE PEELE</a>); ‘Stick-Swap-Pull-Get Pulled,’ a collaborative exhibition at Seventh Gallery, Melbourne (with <a href="http://cheriepeele.com/cheriepeele/HOME.html">CHERIE PEELE</a>); and ‘Made and Found’ at Kunstraum Tapir, Berlin, a group show as part of the Takt artist residency. COLLARD has been the recipient of a number of art prizes, including the Sculpture Foundry Prize (VCA Graduate Exhibition, 2013) and the Sculpture Prize (Proud Exhibition, Margaret Lawrence Gallery, 2012). As well as her own art practice, COLLARD regularly performs in the work of other artists, including Melanie Irwin’s ‘Geodesic Envelopes’ project, which has been shown at Heide Museum of Modern Art, West Space, both Melbourne, and Lehrter Siebzehn, Berlin.</p>
