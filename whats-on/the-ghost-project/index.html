                <p>THE GHOST PROJECT is an installation. And it is a museum. But mostly, it is a discussion. A discussion about imagination, about belief, about cultures. About what you may have experienced and what you may not have.</p>

<p>Drawn from the idea that no matter what science find to be true if alone, at night, in an old dark house with merely a bump any one of us will conjure a ghost and manifest the physiological response it accords; and the knowledge that this is an affliction share by all cultures, original, contemporary, the world over.</p>

<p>To date this ongoing project and its particular combination of performance, story exchange, lecture and installation has been developed and presented in The Czech Republic, South Korea, Hong Kong, Indonesia and rural and urban AustralIa.</p>

<p>For The SUBSTATION Development TREGLOAN will collaborate with DAVID FRANZKE, PAUL JACKSON, CHAMBER MADE OPERA and local residents to present existing material and new instalments in this ongoing exploration of the culturally ubiquitous notion of haunting.</p>

<p>The malleability of truth, the impact of perspective on belief and the potency of imagination. Reality is slippery and the imagination is a fearsome thing.</p>
