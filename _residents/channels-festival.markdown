[CHANNELS FESTIVAL](http://channelsfestival.net.au/) is Australia’s only biennial celebration of video culture since 2013. Showcasing contemporary video practice across Australia and around the world, CHANNELS continues to explore the ultimate mirror medium of our time, challenge the historical contexts of video art and its future progressions in an increasingly tech-saturated world.<br> 
<br>
In 2015, CHANNELS presented an impressive program of 29 events with over 70 artists, partnering with Australian Centre for the Moving Image, Foundation for Art and Creative Technology (UK), Ferry Gallery (Bangkok), Grey Gardens Projects, Centre for Contemporary Photography, Liquid Architecture, Screen Space, The University of Melbourne and more. 
CHANNELS will be presenting a 10-day festival in September 2017 across Melbourne and online including exhibitions, screenings, performances, talks, residencies and workshops.<br>
<br>
The 2017 festival is led by Artistic Directors [NIKKI LAM](http://nikkilam.info/) and [ALICIA RENEW](http://heresheis.org.au/design-and-architecture/2013/08/alicia-renew/)
