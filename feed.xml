&lt;p&gt;During her residency at The SUBSTATION, &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsited.org/2016/01/20/160/&quot;&gt;MARGIE MEDLIN&lt;/a&gt; will research two projects. One, a dance and media public art project that links incidental spectators with large-scale video dance projections and mobile image technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research associates include VICKI VAN HOUT, PATRICK LUCKY LARTEY, ANNA TREGLOAN &amp;amp; MARTIN FOX. The second project in collaboration with PROFESSOR HOLGER DEUTER from the University of Applied Sciences in Kaiserslautern, Germany, researches the theme of weapons design and media technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://unsited.org/2016/01/20/160/&quot;&gt;MARGIE MEDLIN&lt;/a&gt; is an artist, designer and curator. Her work explores the relationship between dance and the moving image, space and light. MEDLIN has created many, varied multi-screen movement performances and installations using technologies ranging from analogue through to state of the art digital systems utilising live video, motion capture, motion control and robotics.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>patternworks_</name></author><summary type="html">THE SUBSTATION</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://thesubstation.org.au/uploads/residency-margie-medlin.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Gail Priest</title><link href="http://thesubstation.org.au/in-development/gail-priest/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Gail Priest" /><published>2016-12-02T11:22:00+11:00</published><updated>2016-12-02T11:22:00+11:00</updated><id>http://thesubstation.org.au/in-development/gail-priest</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://thesubstation.org.au/in-development/gail-priest/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;cove-park-scotland&quot;&gt;COVE PARK, SCOTLAND&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SUBSTATION has partnered with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cryptic.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Cryptic&lt;/a&gt;, Glasgow to offer a reciprocal artist residency between the two organisations. Based about an hour north of Glasgow, Cove Park offers residencies that respond to the diversity of contemporary artistic practice of all art forms. In 2017, Cove Park will host Sydney-based sound artist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gailpriest.net/&quot;&gt;GAIL PRIEST&lt;/a&gt;. PRIEST’s work comprises solo electro-acoustic performance and recordings, sound installations for gallery contexts, sound design for performance and video, as well as curation, critique and advocacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work is conceived as a mini-series, exploring mystery, the unknown, and the nature of fear. Audience members are directed to precincts such as abandoned halls, bars, rail yards, pool halls and unused public spaces where actions, cues and revelations happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The audience must actively engage with each environment in order to uncover the next piece in the puzzle. The work interweaves performance, audience conversation, live radio, walking, sound and video installation.

&lt;p&gt;Led by JAMIE STEWART, ANGELA SEO and SHAYNA DUNKELMAN, the music of XIU XIU defies simple description. It is a complex mix of post punk and synth pop, classical and experimental styles, full of brutality and emotional depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;XIU XIU’s performance isn’t simply a recreation of the Twin Peaks music, but provides an entirely new interpretation that emphasises its chaos, drama, fear, noise and sidelong leering glances.&lt;/p&gt;
