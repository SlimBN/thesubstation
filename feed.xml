        <title>Newport Archives</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;NEWPORT ARCHIVES is an audio tour commissioned by The SUBSTATION in 2016, which explores The SUBSTATION’s own building and surrounding landmarks in Newport.  Drawing on interviews with local residents, NEWPORT ARCHIVES explores the origins of Newport and its surrounds. Equipped with headphones and an mp3 player as their guide, participants walk unaccompanied through Newport’s streets in a journey that uncannily knits the present with past memories.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Xiu Xiu Plays the Music of Twin Peaks</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;xiu-xiuhttpwwwxiuxiuorg-usa&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xiuxiu.org&quot;&gt;XIU XIU&lt;/a&gt; (USA)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iconic music of American TV series &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks&quot;&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/a&gt; by composer Angelo Badalamenti and David Lynch is given a makeover in this special live performance by acclaimed experimental pop group XIU XIU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Led by JAMIE STEWART, ANGELA SEO and SHAYNA DUNKELMAN, the music of XIU XIU defies simple description. It is a complex mix of post punk and synth pop, classical and experimental styles, full of brutality and emotional depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;XIU XIU’s performance isn’t simply a recreation of the Twin Peaks music, but provides an entirely new interpretation that emphasises its chaos, drama, fear, noise and sidelong leering glances.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Cell</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brookandrew.com&quot;&gt;BROOK ANDREW&lt;/a&gt; is one of Australia’s premiere contemporary artists, having exhibited internationally since 1996. His work examines Western history, specifically relating to colonialism, and places Australia at the centre of a global inquisition. ANDREW’s work spans across video, sculpture, photography and immersive installations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SUBSTATION presents the Melbourne premiere of ANDREW’s major installation THE CELL. Decorated in Wiradjuri patterns and inviting audience participation, THE CELL is a jumping castle of sorts, that blurs the lines between sanctuary and detention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commissioned by Sherman Contemporary Art Foundation, Sydney, 2010&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Conflicted: Works from the Vietnam Archive Project</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;THE VIETNAM ARCHIVE PROJECT by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pthngo.com&quot;&gt;PHUONG NGO&lt;/a&gt; is an ongoing artwork started in 2010. Currently consisting over 10,000 items, including slides, photos, documents and objects; this ever-growing collection explores histories that have come to define the personal and collective identities of Vietnamese communities, both within and outside of Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CONFLICTED explores the political and social aspects of war through the lens of service men and women. Utilising found images and objects from the VIETNAM ARCHIVE PROJECT, the exhibition comprises a series of intimate moments and large scale installations offering a nuanced and alternative reading of the Vietnam War.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Megaphone Project</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;madeleine-flynn--tim-humphreyhttphttpmadeleineandtimnet&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://http://madeleineandtim.net/&quot;&gt;MADELEINE FLYNN &amp;amp; TIM HUMPHREY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE MEGAPHONE PROJECT is an interactive sound installation that has engaged over 100,000 people around the world. Taking place in The SUBSTATION’s grand main space, the work explores sound and physical play. The striking red megaphones collect people’s voices that then return unexpectedly via a wireless network. The result is a mixture of order and chaos, anarchy and contemplation as the audience creates a lively environment of play that is their own invention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaborating artists: David Wells, Jennifer Hector&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Tribe</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;live-from-a-backyard-in-newport&quot;&gt;LIVE FROM A BACKYARD IN NEWPORT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After sell-out seasons at Sydney Festival and Belvoir St Theatre, &lt;a href=&quot;http://urbantheatre.com.au&quot;&gt;URBAN THEATRE PROJECTS&lt;/a&gt;’ THE TRIBE comes to The SUBSTATION.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performed by HAZEM SHAMMAS, THE TRIBE is a story of belonging and family, told by the small boy, Bani. At the heart of THE TRIBE is Bani’s love for his Tayta, his grandmother and core presence in his life, who carries all the truths of ‘The Tribe’ – a small Muslim sect who fled to Australia from Lebanon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking place in a Newport backyard, performed alongside cellist and composer OOHAGH SHERRARD, SHAMMAS’s Bani is like a visionary child channeling a Bedouin storyteller. Based on MICHAEL MOHAMMED AHMAD’s award-winning novel, &lt;a href=&quot;http://giramondopublishing.com/product/the-tribe&quot;&gt;THE TRIBE&lt;/a&gt; is an open invitation to listen to an Arab-Australian story from our backyard, in our backyards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adapted by Michael Mohammed Ahmad and Janice Muller&lt;br /&gt;
Based on the novel by Michael Mohammed Ahmad&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Director: Janice Muller&lt;br /&gt;
Performer: Hazem Shammas&lt;br /&gt;
Composer and Performer: Oonagh Sherrard&lt;br /&gt;
Production Manager: Frank Mainoo&lt;br /&gt;

        <title>ONO</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Part music performance, part installation, ONO is a place to gather, listen and share. Drawing on traditions of oral storytelling, four musical offerings will each spin a yarn of ambient and abstract sounds in the belly of The SUBSTATION. ONO seeks to break down the usual back and forth between artist and listener, to create an inclusive and reverberating space of exchange. Bring your imagination on an excursion into outer sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Featuring &lt;a href=&quot;http://soundcloud.com/analogueattic&quot;&gt;ALBRECHT LA’BROOY&lt;/a&gt; (Analogue Attic), &lt;a href=&quot;http://burntfriedman.com&quot;&gt;BURNT FRIEDMAN&lt;/a&gt; (Nonplace/GER), &lt;a href=&quot;http://soundcloud.com/nuel&quot;&gt;NUEL&lt;/a&gt; (Aquaplano/ITA) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://soundcloud.com/sleepd&quot;&gt;SLEEP D&lt;/a&gt; (Butter Sessions)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pose Like This</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recent VCA graduates, &lt;a href=&quot;http://cargocollective.com/emmacollard/&quot;&gt;EMMA COLLARD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://rafaellamcdonald.com.au&quot;&gt;RAFAELLA MCDONALD&lt;/a&gt;, collaborate in their first major exhibition together, POSE LIKE THIS. Developing the work in The SUBSTATION’s galleries, a series of sets for performances spill throughout the space. Utilising materials such as brightly-coloured paint, wood, plastic, mirrors, fabric and found objects, the duo create a range of overlapping environments, intermingled with pre-recorded videos, live recordings, performances and bodily improvisations. Reflecting on various representations of the body, self and the frame, the large network of images and actions examine if a single moment can be flattened or if it must keep circulating through chaos to function.&lt;/p&gt;
