        <title>Antony Hamilton Projects</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Co-commissioned by France’s La Comète Scène Nationale de Châlons en Champagne and The SUBSTATION, &lt;strong&gt;THEY WANT NEW LANGUAGE&lt;/strong&gt; is a collaboration between choreographer, &lt;a href=&quot;http://antonyhamiltonprojects.com&quot;&gt;ANTONY HAMILTON&lt;/a&gt; and percussionist, &lt;a href=&quot;http://matthiasschackarnott.com&quot;&gt;MATTHIAS SCHACK-ARNOTT&lt;/a&gt;. HAMILTON and SCHACK-ARNOTT will dissect the notion of ‘origin’, leaving their usual tools of production outside the studio, instead bringing only the knowledge located in their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>One Step at a Time Like This</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOIR TRAIL&lt;/strong&gt; is an immersive performance event taking place over consecutive days in multiple urban locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work is conceived as a mini-series, exploring mystery, the unknown, and the nature of fear. Audience members are directed to precincts such as abandoned halls, bars, rail yards, pool halls and unused public spaces where actions, cues and revelations happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The audience must actively engage with each environment in order to uncover the next piece in the puzzle. The work interweaves performance, audience conversation, live radio, walking, sound and video installation. As the audience move, they journey further into questions surrounding the perception of fear and what generates it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Alice Dixon, William McBride &amp; Caroline Meaden</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“&lt;i&gt;Women of the world take over, because if you don’t the world will come to an end, and we haven’t got long.&lt;/i&gt;” - Ivor Cutler and Linda Hirst.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;LADY EXAMPLE&lt;/strong&gt; is a literal, detailed examination of women in our lives, city, history, mythology and popular culture. Performers &lt;a href=&quot;http://aliceandcaroline.com.au&quot;&gt;ALICE DIXON, CAROLINE MEADEN&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://oddbody.weebly.com/the-bodies.html&quot;&gt;WILLIAM MCBRIDE&lt;/a&gt; study these women in forensic detail, analysing and inhabiting their carriage, aura, speech and interactions, exploring hidden vulnerabilities and hierarchical power structures at play. In the development of this work, the performers will propose a multifaceted way of being ‘lady’; a ‘total woman’ – who will be able to guide us all forward.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Paea Leach</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PUSHED&lt;/strong&gt; explores the poetics of amplification, embodiment and sensory perception. Driven by dance artist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paealeach.com&quot;&gt;PAEA LEACH&lt;/a&gt;, the work is borne from interests in attention and how we physically experience the environments we live in. Utilising body, sound and light, each form pushes towards a gradual crescendo. &lt;strong&gt;PUSHED&lt;/strong&gt; will be made specifically for and within the belly of The SUBSTATION. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound artists: Madeleine Flynn and Tim Humphrey&lt;br /&gt;
Light/space design artist: Ben Bosco Shaw&lt;br /&gt;
Performers/dancers: Caroline Meaden, Gregory Lorenzutti&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Newport Archives</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;NEWPORT ARCHIVES is an audio tour commissioned by The SUBSTATION in 2016, which explores The SUBSTATION’s own building and surrounding landmarks in Newport.  Drawing on interviews with local residents, NEWPORT ARCHIVES explores the origins of Newport and its surrounds. Equipped with headphones and an mp3 player as their guide, participants walk unaccompanied through Newport’s streets in a journey that uncannily knits the present with past memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audio Design: JOE TALIA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commissioned by The SUBSTATION&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Xiu Xiu Plays the Music of Twin Peaks</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The iconic music of American TV series &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks&quot;&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/a&gt; by composer Angelo Badalamenti and David Lynch is given a makeover in this special live performance by acclaimed experimental pop group &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xiuxiu.org/&quot;&gt;XIU XIU&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Led by JAMIE STEWART, ANGELA SEO and SHAYNA DUNKELMAN, the music of XIU XIU defies simple description. It is a complex mix of post punk and synth pop, classical and experimental styles, full of brutality and emotional depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;XIU XIU’s performance isn’t simply a recreation of the Twin Peaks music, but provides an entirely new interpretation that emphasises its chaos, drama, fear, noise and sidelong leering glances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by The SUBSTATION in association with Room40&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Cell</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brookandrew.com&quot;&gt;BROOK ANDREW&lt;/a&gt; is one of Australia’s premiere contemporary artists, having exhibited internationally since 1996. His work examines Western history, specifically relating to colonialism, and places Australia at the centre of a global inquisition. ANDREW’s work spans across video, sculpture, photography and immersive installations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SUBSTATION presents the Melbourne premiere of ANDREW’s major installation THE CELL. Decorated in Wiradjuri patterns and inviting audience participation, THE CELL is a jumping castle of sorts, that blurs the lines between sanctuary and detention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commissioned by Sherman Contemporary Art Foundation, Sydney, 2010&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Conflicted: Works from the Vietnam Archive Project</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;THE VIETNAM ARCHIVE PROJECT by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pthngo.com&quot;&gt;PHUONG NGO&lt;/a&gt; is an ongoing artwork started in 2010. Currently consisting over 10,000 items, including slides, photos, documents and objects; this ever-growing collection explores histories that have come to define the personal and collective identities of Vietnamese communities, both within and outside of Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CONFLICTED explores the political and social aspects of war through the lens of service men and women. Utilising found images and objects from the VIETNAM ARCHIVE PROJECT, the exhibition comprises a series of intimate moments and large scale installations offering a nuanced and alternative reading of the Vietnam War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by The SUBSTATION and the Human Rights Arts and Film Festival&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Megaphone Project</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;THE MEGAPHONE PROJECT is an interactive sound installation that has engaged over 100,000 people around the world. Taking place in The SUBSTATION’s grand main space, the work explores sound and physical play. The striking red megaphones collect people’s voices that then return unexpectedly via a wireless network. The result is a mixture of order and chaos, anarchy and contemplation as the audience creates a lively environment of play that is their own invention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaborating artists: David Wells, Jennifer Hector&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by The SUBSTATION&lt;/p&gt;
